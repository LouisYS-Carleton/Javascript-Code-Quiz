Code Quiz:

2: Once start has been pressed, a timer starts counting down from 75 seconds. A question will be shown to the user along with possible answers that can be clicked. If a correct answer is chosen the user will get to progress to the next question without any penalties, however if the incorrect answer is selected the user will have to choose again and will lose 10 seconds for every wrong answer. The user will also have the option of restarting the quiz by clicking "Restart" at the top.

3: If the user reaches 10 seconds the timer will turn red, and if they cannot finish the questions by the end of the timer a "restart" alert will appear, immediately redirecting them to the start page.

4: If the user finishes the quiz, a prompt will appear asking for the user's initials. Once the user has given their username (initials), he/she will be redirected to the highscores page where their score will be stored. If the wish to play again their new score will be stored as well, or they can choose to use the "clear scores" button to clear their history.
